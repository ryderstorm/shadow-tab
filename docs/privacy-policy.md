# Privacy Policy for Shadow Tab

Last updated: 2026-01-03

Shadow Tab is a Chrome extension that replaces your New Tab page with a dark loading screen and then redirects you to a URL you configure.

## Data We Collect

Shadow Tab does not collect personal information, analytics, or browsing history.

Shadow Tab stores the following user-provided settings locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`:

- Redirect URL (a hyperlink you enter)
- Redirect delay (milliseconds)
- Background color

## How We Use Data

The stored settings are used only to:

- Redirect your New Tab page to the configured URL
- Apply your chosen delay and background color
- Display and edit your settings on the Options page

## Data Sharing

Shadow Tab does not sell, transfer, or share your data with third parties.

The settings listed above are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to the developer.

## Network Requests

If you enter an `http` or `https` URL in the Options page, Shadow Tab may attempt to validate that the URL is reachable by sending a `HEAD` request to that URL from the extension.

- This request is sent only to the URL you enter.
- No data is sent to the developer.
- No browsing history is collected.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your settings remain stored locally in your browser until you:

- Change them in the Options page, or
- Remove the extension, or
- Clear the extension’s local storage.

## Security

Shadow Tab stores settings using Chrome’s extension storage. Shadow Tab does not transmit stored settings to the developer.
